Animal detection is a rich, up-and-coming field with research around a black box animal detection idea. There has been a lot of work around how to leverage animal/wildlife detection without much open-sourced focus on how to achieve perfect detection. We present our model as a focus on farm versus game chickens. This research carries significant importance due to the rampant avian flu that leads to culling of thousands of livestock chickens each year. Proverbial chickens are used in physics problems as spherical point objects and they quite often resemble spherical objects with slight aberrations (head and legs). We can leverage this as most often complicated rigid shapes require a lot of complicated tensor operations, which is escaped here; game chickens have a distinctive shape that is less spherical. We propose a detailed survey of various state of the art models such as VGGnet, ViT, and ConvNeXt trained to detect chicken data. We also argue that although our methodology is niche, it can be extended to several species. Through our comprehensive study, we show the difficulties of various models for this niche field.
